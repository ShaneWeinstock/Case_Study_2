# Case_Study_2
Group 3

New main Repo for Case Study 2 - Group 3

Per Dr. Cheun : README file details. 
1. There needs to be an informative Readme, complete with several sections, as referenced in Live Session. 
2. Give contact information, session Info, and the objective of the repo at least. 
3. Create a file structure that is accessible and transparent.  Document it in the root directory, ideally in the Readme.
